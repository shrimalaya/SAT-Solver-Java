# SAT Solver Java
Personal Project

- Solves SAT problems from a k-cnf file inserted at runtime
- Use filegerator.py to generate random k-cnf files in DIMACS format
- Run the java program with your filename.txt to see a solution if it is solvable within the set amount of iterations
- Since there's a limit to the depth of recursion in Java, multiple iterations are used to recurse
